Windows
-------

Currently Win32 version can't support SFTP (even with installed Paramiko), we 're trying to solve it.


Linux
-----

For Debian and Ubuntu, the following command will ensure that the required dependencies are installed:

sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev

For Fedora and RHEL-derivatives, the following command will ensure that the required dependencies are installed:

sudo yum install gcc libffi-devel python-devel openssl-devel 


Then install Python's PIP:

sudo apt-get install python3-pip


You should now be able to install cryptography + paramiko with the usual:

sudo pip3 install cryptography
sudo pip3 install paramiko
