Windows
-------

If you’re on Windows you’ll need to make sure you have OpenSSL installed. There are pre-compiled binaries available. If your installation is in an unusual location set the LIB and INCLUDE environment variables to include the corresponding locations. For example:

C:\> set LIB=C:\OpenSSL-1.0.1f-64bit\lib;%LIB%
C:\> set INCLUDE=C:\OpenSSL-1.0.1f-64bit\include;%INCLUDE%


Linux
-----

For Debian and Ubuntu, the following command will ensure that the required dependencies are installed:

sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev

For Fedora and RHEL-derivatives, the following command will ensure that the required dependencies are installed:

sudo yum install gcc libffi-devel python-devel openssl-devel 


Then install Python's PIP:

sudo apt-get install python3-pip


You should now be able to install cryptography + paramiko with the usual:

sudo pip3 install cryptography
sudo pip3 install paramiko
